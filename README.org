defos is the name that I have chosen for my post-installation script that will deploy my Xmonad config, my Emacs config, as well as associated programs that are needed to create a proper "desktop" experience.  defos should work on Arch Linux or any Arch-based distribution.  The programs that will be installed include Xmonad, Xmobar, Doom Emacs, Fish and other programs needed to recreate DT's XMonad desktop.  defos is only for x86_64 architecture and will not work on ARM devices such as the Raspberry Pi.
